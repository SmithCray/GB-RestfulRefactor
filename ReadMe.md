# Restful Refactor: Google Books

### **Description:**

Google Books is a fully functioning [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) search engine built with a RESTful API using the [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) and a [React](https://reactjs.org/) front end, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database, and [Node.js/Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) server and API. Which allows users to save book searches to the back end, sign-in and out, and query Books data all while being presenting with a high-quality responsive and enjoyable user experience via our friend _**"React"**_. Our users are presented with a menu containing the options Search for Books and Login/Signup, as well as a input field to search for books. Google Books presents several search results, each featuring a bookâ€™s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site.

<br>

### **Our Mission:**

We are working to refactor Gooogle Books API and incorperate new performant technologies including [Apollo Servers](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started/) and [GraphQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL) replacing the existing restful API currently used. In addition we will Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the correct context in GraphQL API. Last we will need to create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
